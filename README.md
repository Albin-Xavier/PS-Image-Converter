# ImageConverter-PS1
Convert images using ImageMagick. To the best of my knowledge, this will only function on Microsoft Windows.

## Installation
Download the source code above under "code". Click "Download ZIP" to download the source code. Extract the contents anywhere you like.

## Usage
On first run, the script will automatically download and install ImageMagick. Click yes on the Admin prompt if requested. After ImageMagick is installed, it will create the "Input" folder and give you a chance to put in your images.
Place the images you want to convert in the "Input" folder. Run "Convert Images to JPG.ps1" to convert your photos to JPG, or "Convert Images to PNG.ps1" for PNG conversion.
The all images of the desired image type will be moved to a folder called "Output", while the original images that have been converted will be moved to a folder called "Originals".

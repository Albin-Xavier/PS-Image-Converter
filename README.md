# ImageConverter-PS1
Convert images using ImageMagick. To the best of my knowledge, this will only function on Microsoft Windows.

## Installation

First, install [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows). I recommend the version containing "portable-Q16-x64.zip".
Then, Download the source code above under "code". Click "Download ZIP" to download the source code. Extract the contents anywhere you like.
Now, extract the contents of ImageMagick zip file into a folder called "ImageMagick".
After these steps, the script is now ready for use.

## Usage
Create a folder called "Input", if it does not exist. Place the images you want to convert in the "Input" folder. Run "Convert Images to JPG.ps1" to convert your photos to JPG, or "Convert Images to PNG.ps1" for PNG conversion.
The all images of the desired image type will be moved to a folder called "Output", while the original images that have been converted will be moved to a folder called "Originals".
